En los últimos días me volví adicto a dos jueguitos muy pavos**[](http://web.mit.edu/xiphmont/Public/gPlanarity.html)**

> gPlanarity is a super-clone of the [flash Planarity game written by John Tantalo](http://www.planarity.net/). The original Planarity ran well in IE and Firefox on other platforms, but was slow and liked to lock up or abort under Linux browsers.
>
> gPlanarity implements gameplay identical to the original Planarity but adds some UI and game extras around the basic game such as multiple board generation algorithms, puzzle boards, complete backing state, group select/drag and so on.

**[qonk](http://anthony.liekens.net/index.php/Computers/Qonk)**

> Qonk is a small game I wrote to learn some SDL basics. The game is a small build-and-conquer strategy game with very simple rules. A complete game only lasts for a few minutes and can be a fun break away from work or whatever you're doing.
>
> The setting of the game is a solar system of planets. Your goal is to conquer all of the planets in the game by sending ships there. Planets that are under your control generate new ships. Simple AI players are playing against you. As you gain more experience throughout the game, more AI players have to be kicked out of bigger solar systems.

Si tienen algo de tiempo que _quemar_ y no saben que hacer, les recomiendo ambos :-). Eso si, puede llegar a resultar difícil dejarlos :-D
